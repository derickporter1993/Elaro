## What is Prometheion?

Sentinel makes your Salesforce org **audit-ready and protected from configuration drift** in 24 hours.

**Today (v1.0)**: Sentinel continuously monitors your Salesforce configuration for compliance violations, permission sprawl, and undocumented changes — then generates audit evidence and a baseline compliance report that regulators actually want to see.

**Tomorrow (v1.5+)**: Sentinel evolves into an **AI Compliance Brain** that doesn't just detect drift, but interprets the *intent, impact, and compliance reasoning* behind every change — answering questions no other tool can answer.

**Think of it as**: Your AI compliance analyst that works 24/7, understands regulatory frameworks, and speaks both technical and auditor language.

---

## Why This Exists

- **Audits fail** because nobody can explain who changed what and why
- **Regulated orgs** can't afford Salesforce misconfigurations or permission sprawl
- **Existing tools** are too complex/expensive or not tailored to nonprofits and smaller regulated teams
- **Sentinel** gives them a simple, opinionated compliance guardrail + evidence engine

---

## Who It's For

Sentinel is built for **regulated organizations using Salesforce**:

- 🏥 **Healthcare**: HIPAA compliance, PHI protection, audit trails
- 🏛️ **Government & Nonprofits**: FedRAMP, FISMA, grants management, donor privacy
- 💰 **Financial Services**: SOX, PCI-DSS, transaction auditing
- 🏢 **Any Regulated Org**: SOC 2, GDPR, or compliance frameworks requiring audit evidence

If you're spending weeks preparing for audits, manually reviewing permissions, or can't explain recent configuration changes — Sentinel is for you.

---

## What v1 Does Today

### 1. **Compliance Baseline Scan** 📊

Generates a comprehensive compliance baseline report showing:
- Audit Readiness Score (0-100)
- Top 5 compliance risks ranked by severity
- Permissions overview (who has access to what)
- Sharing rules and data access analysis
- Compliance checklist (HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR, etc.)

**📄 [View Sample Report](examples/compliance-baseline-report-sample.md)**

### 2. **Configuration Drift Detection** 🔍

Tracks Salesforce metadata changes in real-time:
- Profile & permission set modifications
- Sharing rule changes
- Object & field-level security updates
- Setup changes without change control tickets
- Unreviewed production changes

**Alerts you when**: High-risk changes happen (e.g., "Modify All Data" permission granted)

### 3. **Audit Evidence Export** 📁

Automatically collects audit evidence:
- Setup Audit Trail exports
- Field History Tracking data
- Event Monitoring logs (if Shield is enabled)
- Permission set assignment history
- Correlation IDs for tracing changes across systems

**Export formats**: Markdown, CSV, JSON for compliance documentation

### 4. **Audit Readiness Score** 🎯

Calculates a compliance score based on:
- Permission sprawl (how many users have elevated access)
- Audit trail coverage (% of objects with field history enabled)
- Configuration drift (# of unreviewed changes)
- Policy violations (OWD too permissive, no encryption, etc.)

**Score updates**: Real-time as you fix issues

---

## What v1 Does NOT Do (Non-Goals)

To keep Sentinel simple and focused, v1 intentionally:

- ❌ **Does not replace SIEM**: Not a generic security information & event management tool
- ❌ **Does not monitor every SaaS**: Salesforce only (multi-SaaS is v2+)
- ❌ **Does not do complex AI governance**: AI-powered change explanations are v1.5+
- ❌ **Does not prevent changes**: It detects and alerts; it doesn't block (approval workflows are future work)

Sentinel is a **compliance drift detector**, not a full GRC platform.

---

## The Future: AI Compliance Intelligence

Sentinel is evolving into the world's first **AI Compliance Brain** — a system that doesn't just detect drift, but **interprets the meaning, intent, and compliance impact** of every change.

**Vision**: Intelligence, not dashboards.

Where competitors show logs, Sentinel will provide judgment, context, and compliance reasoning.

### Coming in v1.5 (Q2 2025) — AI-Assisted Remediation

#### **Change Intent Analysis** 🧠
The signature feature that sets Sentinel apart — AI that understands the *why* behind every change:

**What competitors show**:
```
Permission Set "Financial_Data_Access" modified by j.smith@acme.org
```

**What Sentinel shows**:

```
⚠️ High-Risk Change Detected

Change: Permission Set "Financial_Data_Access" modified
Changed By: j.smith@acme.org
Risk Score: 8.7/10

AI Analysis:
This change grants 45 users "Modify All Data" permission, which:
• Violates SOC2-CC6.3 (logical access controls)
• Expands donor-data exposure by 340%
• Bypasses approval workflow for financial records
• Fails HIPAA "minimum necessary" access rule (§164.514(d))

Compliance Impact:
- HIPAA: ❌ Non-compliant
- SOC 2: ❌ Control failure (CC6.1)
- SOX: ❌ Segregation of duties violation

Recommended Fix:
Create granular permission set with access to:
- Financial_Transactions__c (Read/Edit only)
- Account.AnnualRevenue (Read only)

Evidence Generated: Attached to audit trail
```

This level of reasoning is **impossible for competitors to match** without rebuilding their entire platform.

#### **Automated Remediation Suggestions** 🛠️
One-click fixes for common compliance violations:
- Remove stale permission set assignments (users inactive >90 days)
- Revert OWD settings to "Private" when changed without approval
- Re-enable Field History Tracking on compliance-sensitive objects

#### **Jira Integration** 🎫
Auto-create tickets for high-risk changes with full compliance evidence attached.

---

### Coming in v2.0 (Q4 2025) — Multi-Org Governance

#### **Compliance Co-Pilot** 🤖
Natural language interface for compliance queries:

```
You: "Show me all risky flows touching PII"
Sentinel: [Displays 12 flows with PII exposure risks, ranked by severity]

You: "Generate SOC2 evidence for Q2"
Sentinel: [Exports audit-ready PDF with all Q2 evidence]

You: "Why did our readiness score drop from 87 to 72?"
Sentinel: "3 high-risk changes detected:
1. 23 users granted 'View All Data' without approval
2. Patient_Records__c sharing changed to Public Read/Write
3. Shield Platform Encryption disabled on SSN__c field"
```

#### **Cross-CRM Unified Governance** 🌐
One compliance model across all your CRMs:
- Salesforce
- HubSpot
- Dynamics 365
- Zendesk
- ServiceNow
- Custom apps

**The Moat**: Once Sentinel builds this unified compliance graph, competitors cannot catch up without 3-4 years of development.

#### **Predictive Risk Modeling** 📈
Proactive alerts before violations happen:

```
⚡ Predictive Alert

Based on recent admin behavior and automation dependencies,
the upcoming Flow deployment has an 87% probability of causing
HIPAA access violations.

Suggested Action: Review Flow permissions before deployment.
```

---

### Why This Matters — Sentinel's Uncopyable Differentiators

1. **AI Change Intent Analysis** — Competitors show *what* changed; Sentinel explains *why it matters*
2. **Automated Compliance Mapping** — Instant mapping to SOC2, HIPAA, NIST, FedRAMP, GDPR
3. **Evidence Packs** — Auto-generated, auditor-ready documentation
4. **Cross-CRM Intelligence** — Unified compliance model (impossible to copy quickly)
5. **Nonprofit-Focused** — Purpose-built for regulated nonprofits (underserved market)

**No one else is building this.**

## Core Features in Detail

### Compliance Baseline Scan

**What it does**: Scans your Salesforce org's configuration and generates a compliance baseline report.

**What it scans**:
- Profiles and Permission Sets (elevated permissions, stale assignments)
- Sharing Rules and OWD settings (over-permissioned objects)
- Object and Field-Level Security (sensitive data exposure)
- Audit Trail configuration (Field History, Event Monitoring)
- Platform Encryption status (Shield enabled/disabled)

**How to use**:
```apex
// Programmatically trigger a scan
ComplianceBaselineScanner scanner = new ComplianceBaselineScanner();
ComplianceReport report = scanner.runScan();
System.debug('Audit Readiness Score: ' + report.getScore());
```

Or use the Lightning Web Component dashboard (navigate to Sentinel app).

---

### Configuration Drift Detection

**What it does**: Monitors Setup Audit Trail and Field History for configuration changes.

**What it tracks**:
- Profile/Permission Set modifications
- Sharing Rule changes
- Custom Object/Field changes
- User permission assignments
- Integration/Connected App changes

**How it works**:
1. **Platform Events**: Sentinel listens to Salesforce Platform Events for real-time changes
2. **Scheduled Jobs**: Runs hourly to poll Setup Audit Trail API
3. **Risk Scoring**: Each change is scored based on impact (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
4. **Alerting**: High-risk changes trigger Slack/email notifications

**Sample alert**:
```
⚠️ Sentinel Drift Alert

Change: Permission Set Modified
Object: Financial_Data_Access
Changed By: j.smith@acme.org
Risk Level: 🔴 High
Reason: Grants "Modify All Data" without change control ticket
Action Required: Review and approve or rollback
```

**Schedule automatic scans**:
```bash
# Run this script to schedule hourly drift detection
./scripts/scheduleApiSnapshot.sh myorg
```

---

### Audit Evidence Export

**What it does**: Collects and exports audit evidence required by auditors.

**Evidence collected**:
- Setup Audit Trail (last 180 days)
- Field History records for compliance-sensitive objects
- Permission set assignment changes
- Login history and session activity (if Event Monitoring enabled)

**Export formats**:
- **Markdown**: Human-readable reports
- **CSV**: For import into GRC tools
- **JSON**: For SIEM integration

**Export a compliance report**:
```bash
# Using Salesforce CLI
sf apex run --file scripts/exportEvidenceReport.apex --target-org myorg

# Or use the LWC dashboard
# Navigate to Sentinel → Reports → Export Compliance Evidence
```

---

### Audit Readiness Score

**How it's calculated**:

| Factor | Weight | Criteria |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Permission Sprawl** | 30% | # of users with "Modify All" or "View All" permissions |
| **Audit Trail Coverage** | 25% | % of compliance-sensitive objects with Field History enabled |
| **Configuration Drift** | 20% | # of unreviewed high-risk changes in last 30 days |
| **Encryption Status** | 15% | Shield Platform Encryption enabled for PHI/PII fields |
| **Policy Compliance** | 10% | OWD settings, session timeout, password policy |

**Example score calculation**:
```
Base Score: 100

Deductions:
- 127 users with "Modify All Data": -20 points
- Field History not enabled on Patient_Records__c: -10 points
- 34 unreviewed changes: -15 points
- Shield Platform Encryption disabled: -10 points
- OWD set to "Public Read/Write" on 2 objects: -8 points

Final Score: 100 - 63 = 37/100 (🔴 Critical)
```

**Improving your score**:
1. Follow the "Suggested Actions" in your baseline report
2. Re-run the scan after making changes
3. Track score improvements over time

## FAQ

### Q: Does Sentinel prevent users from making non-compliant changes?

**A**: Not in v1. Sentinel **detects** and **alerts** on drift, but doesn't block changes. Automated remediation and approval workflows are planned for v2+.

### Q: Does Sentinel require Shield Platform Encryption?

**A**: No, but it will flag missing encryption as a compliance risk in your baseline report. If you need HIPAA or SOX compliance, Shield is strongly recommended.

### Q: Can I use Sentinel in a sandbox?

**A**: Yes! We recommend testing in a sandbox first. Sentinel works in Production, Sandbox, Scratch Orgs, and Developer Orgs.

### Q: Does Sentinel store data outside Salesforce?

**A**: No. All data stays in your Salesforce org. Sentinel does not send data to external servers (except for Slack/Jira if you configure those integrations).

### Q: What about GDPR compliance?

**A**: Sentinel helps with GDPR by tracking access to personal data and providing audit evidence. See the [Compliance section in the full README](docs/compliance-frameworks.md) for details.

### Q: Can I customize the Audit Readiness Score calculation?

**A**: Not yet. Custom scoring is planned for v2. For now, the score is based on industry best practices (NIST 800-53, HIPAA, SOC 2).
