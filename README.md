7. Security Model and Data Access
	•	Record Security: WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED on SOQL; Security.stripInaccessible() on all DML
	•	Sharing: with sharing classes; row-level security respected
	•	Permissions: least-privilege via OpsGuardian_Admin and dedicated field/object perms
	•	Segregation: multi-org ingestion keyed by org/business unit; no cross-org leakage
	•	Transport: TLS 1.3; OAuth 2.0 JWT/Client-Credentials; no secrets in source

⸻

8. Data Privacy, Retention, and Erasure
	•	Retention: default 180 days, configurable in CMDT; policy-driven purge windows per object/severity
	•	Erasure: admin-initiated deletion via Flow; batch jobs purge data and anonymize residual logs
	•	Encryption: Shield at rest; TLS 1.3 in transit; KMS key rotation per Salesforce policy
	•	See /docs/compliance/ for encryption, deletion, and data-flow artifacts

⸻

9. Configuration Guide

A. Policies (CMDT)
	1.	Setup → Custom Metadata Types → OG_Policy__mdt
	2.	Create records for CPU/SOQL/DML thresholds per environment
	3.	Commit CMDT records to VCS for code review

B. OAuth Named Credential (JWT)
	1.	Setup → External Credentials → create OG_AI (JWT Bearer)
	2.	Setup → Named Credentials → create OG_AI with the AI endpoint
	3.	Assign the principal to the OpsGuardian_Admin permission set

C. Platform Events
	1.	Verify Performance_Alert__e
	2.	Subscribe via Flow or Apex Trigger to route alerts to Slack/Jira

D. Permission Sets
	•	Assign OpsGuardian_Admin to admins only
	•	Verify field-level perms on OpsGuardian_History__c

STRIDE summary
	•	Spoofing: JWT validation + audience checks
	•	Tampering: WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED, stripInaccessible, Shield
	•	Repudiation: append-only logs with correlation IDs
	•	Information Disclosure: FLS/CRUD, field-level encryption
	•	DoS: Platform Cache rate limiting (429 + Retry-After)
	•	Elevation of Privilege: least-privilege perm sets; with sharing

⸻

13. Performance & Scalability
	•	Async: Queueable/Batch Apex for logging and heavy processing
	•	Rate Limiting: Platform Cache-backed sliding windows with HTTP 429 Retry-After
	•	Bulk Safety: governor-aware queries; selective indexes; LDS for UI caching
	•	Load Controls: configurable telemetry granularity; dashboard refresh intervals

⸻

14. Performance Benchmarks

Methodology
	•	Dataset: ~1M history records; ~10K events/hour
	•	Org: Enterprise Edition; API v62.0
	•	Tests: bulk ingest, dashboard refresh, risk scoring

Targets

Scenario	P50	P95	Notes
Ingest API (per request)	90ms	180ms	Queueable insert
Dashboard refresh	600ms	1200ms	Indexed + LDS
Risk scoring (1k recs)	120ms	250ms	Heuristic baseline

Tuning: set dashboard refresh 60–120s; batch compaction nightly; env-specific CMDT thresholds.

15. Operations Runbook

Alert taxonomy

Severity	Example	Action
Critical	CPU breach persists 5 minutes	Auto-open Jira P1, page on-call
High	Flow fault rate > 5%	Triage within 4h, create task
Normal	Event delivery retry	Monitor, no ticket

First response
	1.	Confirm impact (org/business unit)
	2.	Check recent deploys; correlate with Correlation_Id__c
	3.	Execute remediation Flow (rollback, throttle)

Escalation
	•	If not resolved in 30 minutes for Critical, engage Security & App Owner
	•	Post-mortem due within 5 business days

⸻

16. Advanced Integration Scenarios
	•	SIEM: stream Platform Events to Splunk/ELK/Datadog
	•	ITSM: Jira/ServiceNow ticketing from remediation flows
	•	Multi-Cloud: MuleSoft pipelines; hub-and-spoke org aggregation

⸻

17. Security Testing & Audit
	•	Static Analysis: PMD + sf-scanner on PRs; OWASP rulesets
	•	Unit/Integration: Apex and Jest with coverage reports; target ≥95%
	•	DAST: authenticated API smoke tests against scratch/sandbox
	•	Audit Trails: admin actions, policy edits, package updates logged

⸻

18. Localization & Internationalization
	•	Labels: all UI strings externalized to Custom Labels
	•	Translations: Translation Workbench support; date/number formats localized
	•	Accessibility: ARIA attributes; keyboard navigation; SLDS contrast

⸻

19. Documentation & Support
	•	Docs: /docs/ for architecture, compliance, and operations
	•	Troubleshooting: common errors and remediation steps in /docs
	•	Support: contact in SUPPORT.md; incident SLAs in /docs/compliance/incident-response.md

20. Installation

Scratch Org (developer testing)

sfdx force:auth:web:login -d -a DevHub
sfdx force:org:create -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a OGCCX -d 7
sfdx force:source:push
sfdx force:user:permset:assign -n OpsGuardian_Admin
sfdx force:org:open -p /lightning/app/OpsGuardian

Sandbox (UAT)
	1.	Install package: https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=XXXXXXXX
	2.	Assign OpsGuardian_Admin permission set
	3.	Upload Chart.js static resource if dashboards are blank

Production (AppExchange)
	•	AppExchange link (when published)
	•	Supports upgrade via 2GP; CMDT/data preserved

⸻

21. Usage
	•	Open the OpsGuardian Lightning app for dashboards and tiles
	•	Review events in OpsGuardian_History__c and Platform Event subscriptions
	•	Configure thresholds/policies in OG_Policy__mdt
	•	Enable remediation flows and optional Slack/Jira plugins

⸻

22. Plugin SDK

Interface

public interface OG_Plugin {
  void send(OpsGuardian_History__c eventRec);
  Boolean supports(String eventType, String severity);
}

Registration
	•	Implement OG_Plugin in a namespaced class
	•	Add CMDT record OG_Plugin_Config__mdt with class name and filters
	•	Service factory discovers enabled plugins and invokes send(...)

⸻

23. Release Management & Rollback
	•	Versioning: SemVer; package release notes and change logs
	•	Upgrades: 2GP managed package; CMDT and data preserved; perms auto-updated
	•	Rollback: tagged package versions; uninstall/restore procedures documented

⸻

24. Upgrade & Migration
	•	Breaking changes are versioned; deprecations maintained for two minor releases
	•	Rollback: uninstall latest package, reinstall N-1; re-assign perm sets
	•	Post-upgrade: run /scripts/post-upgrade.apex to backfill new fields

⸻

25. Troubleshooting & FAQ
	•	Charts are blank
Upload Chart.js static resource; clear app cache.
	•	FLS/DML exceptions during ingest
Verify OpsGuardian_Admin field-level perms; confirm stripInaccessible is deployed.
	•	429 responses from ingest
Org is rate-limited; inspect Platform Cache keys rl:*; lower event volume or increase quota.
	•	Einstein scoring not showing
Enable Prediction Builder model and grant user permission set license.
