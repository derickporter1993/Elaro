# Cost Estimate Command

You are a senior software engineering consultant tasked with estimating the development cost of the current codebase. This command is **stack-agnostic** — first detect what the project is actually built with, then apply the methodology below. Do not assume any particular language, framework, or platform.

## Step 1: Detect the Stack and Analyze the Codebase

Begin by discovering the project's composition — never assume it. Use Glob and Read to:

1. **Identify languages present.** Enumerate source files and group by extension/language (e.g., `.ts/.js`, `.py`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.java`, `.cls` (Apex), `.swift`, `.cpp`, `.rb`, `.php`, SQL, shaders, etc.). If a tool like `cloc`, `tokei`, or `scc` is available, use it; otherwise count with `git ls-files` + line counts.
2. **Map the structure.** Locate the main source directories, test directories, infrastructure/config, and docs by inspecting the repo layout and any manifest files (`package.json`, `pom.xml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `sfdx-project.json`, `requirements.txt`, `*.csproj`, etc.).
3. **Read representative files** from each major area to gauge complexity, not just line count.

Build a picture of:
- **Total lines of code, broken down by language** (production vs. test vs. generated/vendored — exclude vendored/`node_modules`/build output).
- **Architectural complexity**: frameworks, services, APIs, integrations, data stores.
- **Advanced/specialized work**: anything that is inherently slower to build (concurrency, low-level/native interop, GPU/graphics, cryptography, distributed systems, ML, real-time media, compliance-driven logic, platform extensions, etc.).
- **Testing coverage**: ratio of test code to production code, presence of unit/integration/e2e tests.
- **Documentation quality**: READMEs, API docs, inline docs, architecture docs.

## Step 2: Calculate Development Hours

Based on industry standards for a **senior developer** (5+ years experience) in the relevant stack. Classify each portion of the codebase into a complexity tier and apply the matching rate.

**Hourly Productivity Estimates** (tier by what the code *does*, regardless of language):
- Simple CRUD / UI / boilerplate: 30-50 lines/hour
- Standard application logic: 25-40 lines/hour
- Complex business logic / domain rules: 20-30 lines/hour
- Performance-critical or low-level code (concurrency, GPU, kernel, native interop): 10-20 lines/hour
- Specialized domains (video/audio, cryptography, ML, distributed systems): 10-15 lines/hour
- Plugins / extensions / system or platform integration: 8-12 lines/hour
- Comprehensive tests: 25-40 lines/hour
- Infrastructure-as-code / config / schema / metadata: 30-50 lines/hour

**Additional Time Factors**:
- Architecture & design: +15-20% of coding time
- Debugging & troubleshooting: +25-30% of coding time
- Code review & refactoring: +10-15% of coding time
- Documentation: +10-15% of coding time
- Integration & testing: +20-25% of coding time
- Learning curve (new/specialized frameworks): +10-20% for specialized tech

**Calculate total hours** considering:
1. Base coding hours (lines of code per tier ÷ that tier's productivity rate)
2. Multipliers for complexity and overhead
3. Phases/modules completed vs. remaining
4. Specialized knowledge required (name the specific specialized areas you detected in Step 1)

## Step 3: Research Market Rates

Use WebSearch to find current hourly rates for the **stack you actually detected**. Template the queries with the primary language/platform and the current year:

- "senior {primary language/platform} developer hourly rate {year}"
- "{specialized skill detected} developer contractor rate {year}" (e.g., the niche framework, cloud, or domain that dominates the codebase)
- "senior software engineer hourly rate United States {year}"
- "{primary stack} freelance developer rate {year}"

Capture:
- Senior developers (5-10 years experience) in this stack
- Specialized/niche skill premiums relevant to this codebase
- Contractors vs. employees
- Geographic variation (US markets: SF Bay Area, NYC, Austin, Remote, plus offshore if relevant)

## Step 4: Calculate Organizational Overhead

Real companies don't have developers coding 40 hours/week. Account for typical organizational overhead to convert raw development hours into realistic calendar time.

**Weekly Time Allocation for Typical Company**:

| Activity | Hours/Week | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| **Pure coding time** | 20-25 hrs | Actual focused development |
| Daily standups | 1.25 hrs | 15 min × 5 days |
| Weekly team sync | 1-2 hrs | All-hands, team meetings |
| 1:1s with manager | 0.5-1 hr | Weekly or biweekly |
| Sprint planning/retro | 1-2 hrs | Per week average |
| Code reviews (giving) | 2-3 hrs | Reviewing teammates' work |
| Slack/email/async | 3-5 hrs | Communication overhead |
| Context switching | 2-4 hrs | Interruptions, task switching |
| Ad-hoc meetings | 1-2 hrs | Unplanned discussions |
| Admin/HR/tooling | 1-2 hrs | Timesheets, tools, access requests |

**Coding Efficiency Factor**:
- **Startup (lean)**: 60-70% coding time (~24-28 hrs/week)
- **Growth company**: 50-60% coding time (~20-24 hrs/week)
- **Enterprise**: 40-50% coding time (~16-20 hrs/week)
- **Large bureaucracy**: 30-40% coding time (~12-16 hrs/week)

**Calendar Weeks Calculation**:
```
Calendar Weeks = Raw Dev Hours ÷ (40 × Efficiency Factor)
```

Example: 3,288 raw dev hours at 50% efficiency = 3,288 ÷ 20 = **164.4 weeks** (~3.2 years)

## Step 5: Calculate Full Team Cost

Engineering doesn't ship products alone. Calculate the fully-loaded team cost including all supporting roles.

**Supporting Role Ratios** (expressed as ratio to engineering hours):

| Role | Ratio to Eng Hours | Typical Rate | Notes |
|------|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| Product Management | 0.25-0.40× | $125-200/hr | PRDs, roadmap, stakeholder mgmt |
| UX/UI Design | 0.20-0.35× | $100-175/hr | Wireframes, mockups, design systems |
| Engineering Management | 0.12-0.20× | $150-225/hr | 1:1s, hiring, performance, strategy |
| QA/Testing | 0.15-0.25× | $75-125/hr | Test plans, manual testing, automation |
| Project/Program Management | 0.08-0.15× | $100-150/hr | Schedules, dependencies, status |
| Technical Writing | 0.05-0.10× | $75-125/hr | User docs, API docs, internal docs |
| DevOps/Platform | 0.10-0.20× | $125-200/hr | CI/CD, infra, deployments |

**Team Composition by Company Stage**:

| Stage | PM | Design | EM | QA | PgM | Docs | DevOps |
|-------|-----|--------|-----|-----|------|------|--------|
| Solo/Founder | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Lean Startup | 15% | 15% | 5% | 5% | 0% | 0% | 5% |
| Growth Company | 30% | 25% | 15% | 20% | 10% | 5% | 15% |
| Enterprise | 40% | 35% | 20% | 25% | 15% | 10% | 20% |

**Full Team Multiplier**:
- **Solo/Founder**: 1.0× (just engineering)
- **Lean Startup**: ~1.45× engineering cost
- **Growth Company**: ~2.2× engineering cost
- **Enterprise**: ~2.65× engineering cost

**Calculation**:
```
Full Team Cost = Engineering Cost × Team Multiplier
```

Example: $500K engineering cost at Growth Company = $500K × 2.2 = **$1.1M total team cost**

## Step 6: Generate Cost Estimate

Provide a comprehensive estimate in this format. Replace every bracketed placeholder with detected values, and label sections using the **actual project name and the languages you found** (do not carry over names or languages from any other project).

   - Marketing & sales
   - Legal & compliance
   - Office/equipment
   - Hosting/infrastructure
   - Ongoing maintenance post-launch

### Comparison: AI-Assisted Development

**Estimated time savings with Claude Code**: [X]%
**Effective hourly rate with AI assistance**: ~$[X]/hour equivalent productivity

## Step 7: Calculate Claude ROI — Value Per Claude Hour

This is the most important metric for understanding AI-assisted development efficiency. It answers: **"What did each hour of Claude's actual working time produce?"**

### 7a: Determine Actual Claude Clock Time

**Method 1: Git History (preferred)**

Run `git log --format="%ai" | sort` to get all commit timestamps. Then:
1. **First commit** = project start
2. **Last commit** = current state
3. **Total calendar days** = last - first
4. **Cluster commits into sessions**: group commits within 4-hour windows as one session
5. **Estimate session duration**: each session ≈ 1-4 hours of active Claude work (use commit density as signal — many commits = longer session)

**Session Duration Heuristics**:
- 1-2 commits in a window → ~1 hour session
- 3-5 commits in a window → ~2 hour session
- 6-10 commits in a window → ~3 hour session
- 10+ commits in a window → ~4 hour session

**Method 2: File Modification Timestamps (no git)**

Use a portable listing of source-file modification times and apply the same session-clustering logic. Prefer git where available; otherwise use whatever file-stat tool the platform provides (e.g., `find <src> -type f -printf '%T+\n' | sort` on Linux, or `stat` on macOS). Restrict to source directories and exclude vendored/build output.

**Method 3: Fallback Estimate**

If no reliable timestamps, estimate from lines of code:
- Assume Claude writes 200-500 lines of meaningful code per hour (much faster than humans)
- Claude active hours ≈ Total LOC ÷ 350

### 7b: Calculate Value per Claude Hour

```
Value per Claude Hour = Total Code Value (from Step 5) ÷ Estimated Claude Active Hours
```

Calculate across scenarios:

| Code Value Scenario | Claude Hours (est.) | Value per Claude Hour |
|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Engineering only (avg) | [X] hrs | **$[X,XXX]/hr** |
| Full team equivalent (Growth Co) | [X] hrs | **$[X,XXX]/hr** |
| Full team equivalent (Enterprise) | [X] hrs | **$[X,XXX]/hr** |

### 7c: Claude Efficiency vs. Human Developer

**Speed Multiplier**:
```
Speed Multiplier = Human Dev Hours ÷ Claude Active Hours
```

Example: If a human would need 500 hours but Claude did it in 20 hours → 25× faster

**Cost Efficiency**:
```
Human Cost = Human Hours × $150/hr
Claude Cost = Subscription ($20-200/month) + API costs (estimate from project size)
Savings = Human Cost - Claude Cost
ROI = Savings ÷ Claude Cost
```

### 7d: Output Format

Add this section to the final report:

### Claude ROI Analysis

**Project Timeline**:
- First commit / project start: [date]
- Latest commit: [date]
- Total calendar time: [X] days ([X] weeks)

**Claude Active Hours Estimate**:
- Total sessions identified: [X] sessions
- Estimated active hours: [X] hours
- Method: [git clustering / file timestamps / LOC estimate]

**Value per Claude Hour**:

| Value Basis | Total Value | Claude Hours | $/Claude Hour |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| Engineering only | $[X] | [X] hrs | **$[X,XXX]/Claude hr** |
| Full team (Growth Co) | $[X] | [X] hrs | **$[X,XXX]/Claude hr** |

**Speed vs. Human Developer**:
- Estimated human hours for same work: [X] hours
- Claude active hours: [X] hours
- **Speed multiplier: [X]×** (Claude was [X]× faster)

**Cost Comparison**:
- Human developer cost: $[X] (at $150/hr avg)
- Estimated Claude cost: $[X] (subscription + API)
- **Net savings: $[X]**
- **ROI: [X]×** (every $1 spent on Claude produced $[X] of value)

**The headline number**: *Claude worked for approximately [X] hours and produced the equivalent of $[X] in professional development value — roughly **$[X,XXX] per Claude hour**.*

## Notes

Present the estimate in a clear, professional format suitable for sharing with stakeholders. Include confidence intervals and key assumptions. Highlight areas of highest complexity that drive cost. Always ground the report in the **actual detected stack** — if a metric (e.g., a language or framework) does not apply to this repo, omit it rather than carrying over an irrelevant placeholder.
