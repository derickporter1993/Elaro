# Elaro Deep Dive, Remaining Work, and Delivery Backlogs

## Scope and Method

This deep dive was executed against the entire repository snapshot.

- Total files enumerated: **2,146** via `rg --files`.
- Full file inventory captured in: `docs/planning/FILE_REVIEW_INVENTORY.txt`.
- High-level codebase distribution (from filesystem scan):
  - Salesforce metadata-heavy core (`force-app/`)
  - Secondary package (`force-app-healthcheck/`)
  - Platform TypeScript workspace (`platform/`)
  - Operational docs and AppExchange readiness docs (`docs/`)
  - Automation scripts (`scripts/`)

## Executive Summary: What’s Left

Elaro is functionally broad and test-rich on LWC, but the remaining delivery risk is concentrated in **release readiness and governance hardening**, not basic feature scaffolding.

### Top Remaining Gaps (ranked)

1. **AppExchange security/readiness closure remains the critical path**
   - Security docs still track unresolved/high-priority items (notably final security evidence packaging). Note: PagerDuty key management has been fully resolved — the routing key is retrieved from Protected Custom Metadata (`Elaro_API_Config__mdt`) and is confirmed implemented as of 2026-01-11 (see `docs/security/PAGERDUTY_INTEGRATION_SECURITY_REVIEW.md`).
   - Multiple archived readiness reports still indicate blocker categories that require fresh verification runs (scanner artifacts, security packaging discipline, final submission checklist).

2. **Delivery-status docs are inconsistent/stale vs current code reality**
   - `HANDOFF.md` flags several streams as not started or partially complete, while current code/test inventory shows substantial implementation already present (e.g., Trust Center and SEC LWC tests exist).
   - This creates execution ambiguity and can misallocate team capacity.

3. **Packaging/release prerequisites include explicit TODO namespace placeholders**
   - `sfdx-project.json` still includes namespace-registration TODO markers for package operations.

4. **One remaining production TODO marker exists in Apex**
   - `ElaroGraphIndexer.cls` retains a tracked Einstein integration TODO (fallback is implemented; no immediate functional breakage).

5. **Integration + non-functional quality gates need systematic rerun + publication**
   - Unit tests run green locally (Jest), but final release gates should also include org-based Apex, scanner, accessibility, and security evidence bundle outputs with reproducible artifacts.

## “Solutions Created” (Actionable Remediation Plan)

## Solution 1 — Establish a Single Source of Truth for Completion

**Problem:** conflicting “what’s done / what’s left” views across `HANDOFF.md`, archive status docs, and current code.

**Action:**
- Create and maintain a canonical delivery board doc (`docs/planning/DELIVERY_STATUS_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`) keyed by workstream with objective evidence columns:
  - metadata present
  - tests present
  - deployment verified
  - security reviewed
  - AppExchange artifact complete
- Mark legacy status docs as archival-only.

**Owner:** Team B (Program & QA) with Engineering approval.

## Solution 2 — Close Release-Blocking Security and Packaging Gates

**Problem:** readiness evidence appears fragmented across planning docs.

**Action:**
- Run and capture all mandatory quality/security outputs into `docs/release-evidence/<date>/`:
  - code analyzer results
  - AppExchange scanner outputs
  - accessibility audit result
  - final dependency/security scan outputs
- PagerDuty key management is already implemented (routing key retrieved from Protected Custom Metadata `Elaro_API_Config__mdt`; see `docs/security/PAGERDUTY_INTEGRATION_SECURITY_REVIEW.md`, status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED 2026-01-11). Capture this as completed evidence in the release bundle.

**Owner:** Team B lead + Security engineer.

## Solution 3 — Formalize Namespace and Packaging Prerequisites

**Problem:** explicit TODO markers in project config can block packaging flow late.

**Action:**
- Replace namespace TODO placeholders with validated release checklist item and signed-off environment readiness steps.
- Add CI check that fails if `_TODO_` keys remain in packaging-critical config.

**Owner:** Team B (Release).

## Solution 4 — Track and Triage the Remaining Apex TODO

**Problem:** Einstein callout path intentionally deferred; should be tracked as explicit debt with target release.

**Action:**
- Convert current TODO into tracked issue with:
  - decision (keep fallback-only OR implement Einstein integration)
  - acceptance criteria
  - security/privacy implications
  - target sprint/release

**Owner:** Team A (Core Platform).

## Solution 5 — Lock an Architecture-Forward “New Design & Implementation” Stream

**Problem:** large repo breadth requires a focused modernization lane to prevent drift.

**Action:**
- Launch a dedicated initiative for design-system and implementation consistency:
  - shared UX patterns and token governance
  - standardized telemetry and error model
  - cross-module service contracts
  - performance + observability baselines

**Owner:** **Team New Design & Implementation (You lead).**

## Backlog A — Core Platform & Architecture (Team A)

### Sprint 1 (Foundation + Risk Burn-down)

1. **A-1: Canonical architecture inventory validation**
   - Verify all major modules/services against current runtime behavior.
   - Output: `docs/planning/ARCHITECTURE_INVENTORY_VALIDATED.md`.

2. **A-2: Einstein integration decision record**
   - Create ADR for GraphIndexer Einstein path (fallback-only vs integrated).
   - Output: ADR + implementation ticket.

3. **A-3: Deterministic compliance evidence model review**
   - Ensure hashing/audit patterns remain deterministic and documented.
   - Output: updated technical evidence doc.

4. **A-4: Rule/service interface contract hardening**
   - Define typed service contract expectations for major compliance engines.
   - Output: contract matrix and implementation gaps.

### Sprint 2 (Implementation and Stabilization)

5. **A-5: Implement selected Einstein path decision**
   - Either production-grade integration or TODO removal with codified fallback policy.

6. **A-6: Batch/async modernization closure**
   - Identify remaining legacy async patterns and migrate to approved framework.

7. **A-7: Cross-framework parity review**
   - Validate all target frameworks have consistent scoring/remediation hooks.

8. **A-8: Technical debt cleanup pass**
   - Remove dead comments, stale references, and non-canonical docs links.

### Leadership Charter (90-day)

1. **Design System Unification**
   - Shared component guidelines, accessibility baselines, naming standards.

2. **Implementation Blueprint**

3. **Quality by Default**
   - Mandatory test templates and static checks for new workstreams.

4. **Evidence-First Delivery**
   - Every feature closes with a release evidence bundle and runbook updates.
