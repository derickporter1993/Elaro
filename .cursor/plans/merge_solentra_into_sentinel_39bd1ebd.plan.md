## Quality Standards (Required)

All merged code must meet these standards as of January 3, 2026:

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum 80% coverage** for all Apex classes
- Test all positive, negative, and edge cases
- Include governor limit testing
- Use `@TestSetup` for efficient test data
- Mock all external callouts

### Security Best Practices

- **WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED** on all SOQL queries
- **with sharing** on all Apex classes (unless explicitly `without sharing`)
- **Security.stripInaccessible()** before DML operations
- Input validation and SOQL injection prevention
- Object/field/operator whitelisting for dynamic queries
- Protected Custom Metadata for sensitive data (API keys)

### Code Quality Standards

- Follow Salesforce Apex Style Guide
- Meaningful variable and method names
- Comprehensive documentation for public methods
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- No hardcoded values (use Custom Settings/Metadata)
- Bulkified code (no SOQL/DML in loops)

### Developer Best Practices

- Consistent naming conventions (Elaro prefix)
- DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Proper separation of concerns
- Version control best practices (meaningful commits)

## Recommended Approach: Merge Solentra INTO Sentinel

**Why Sentinel as the base:**

1. Sentinel uses API v65.0 (newer) vs Solentra's v64.0
2. Sentinel has more developed analytics (KPI, Matrix, Trends)
3. Sentinel already has "Elaro" branding throughout
4. Sentinel is more actively developed (more branches, recent changes)

---

## Merge Strategy

### Phase 1: Pre-Merge Preparation

1. Create backup branch in Sentinel
2. Standardize naming to "Elaro" brand
3. Resolve naming conflicts (Sentinel/Solentra prefixes -> Elaro)

### Phase 2: Merge Execution

1. Add Solentra as git remote
2. Merge with `--allow-unrelated-histories`
3. Resolve conflicts for 21 overlapping Apex classes
4. Resolve conflicts for 7 overlapping LWCs
5. Resolve conflicts for 7 overlapping Objects

### Phase 3: Post-Merge Cleanup

1. Rename all "Sentinel*" and "Solentra*" prefixes to "Elaro\_"
2. Update all references in code
3. Consolidate duplicate functionality
4. Update API version to 65.0
5. Merge package.json dependencies
6. Update README with combined documentation

### Phase 4: Quality Validation

1. **Deploy & Test**
   - Deploy to scratch org
   - Run all Apex tests with code coverage
   - Verify 80%+ coverage on all classes

2. **Security Audit**
   - Verify `WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED` on all SOQL
   - Check `with sharing` on all classes
   - Validate input sanitization
   - Review FLS/CRUD enforcement

3. **Code Quality Review**
   - Check naming conventions (Elaro prefix)
   - Verify bulkification (no SOQL in loops)
   - Review error handling
   - Validate documentation

4. **Functional Testing**
   - Test LWC functionality
   - Validate AI Copilot integration
   - Test all analytics dashboards
   - Verify notifications (Slack/Teams)

---

## Conflict Resolution Strategy

For the 21 overlapping Apex classes, compare and choose:

- Use Sentinel version if it has newer code/fixes
- Use Solentra version if it has additional features
- Merge features from both if significantly different

Key files to compare:

- [SlackNotifier.cls](force-app/main/default/classes/SlackNotifier.cls) - has known issues in Sentinel
- [PerformanceRuleEngine.cls](force-app/main/default/classes/PerformanceRuleEngine.cls) - CCX_Settings dependency

## Next Steps

To proceed, switch to **Agent mode** and I will:

1. **Backup & Prepare**
   - Create backup branch in Sentinel
   - Add Solentra as remote

2. **Execute Merge**
   - Merge with `--allow-unrelated-histories`
   - Resolve all 35 component conflicts intelligently
   - Preserve best features from both repos

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Ensure 80%+ test coverage on ALL classes
   - Apply 2026 security best practices
   - Follow Salesforce coding standards
   - Bulkify all code

4. **Branding & Cleanup**
   - Rename to Elaro branding
   - Consolidate dependencies
   - Update to API v65.0

5. **Validation**
   - Deploy to scratch org
   - Run comprehensive test suite
   - Verify security compliance
   - Functional testing of all features

**Quality Guarantee**: All code will meet or exceed 80% test coverage and follow current Salesforce security best practices.
